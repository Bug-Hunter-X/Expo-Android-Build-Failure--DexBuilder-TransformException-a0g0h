// bugSolution.js
// This file demonstrates solutions for the DexBuilder TransformException during Expo Android builds.

// 1. Code Splitting:
// Divide your application into smaller, independent modules. This reduces the size of each individual module
// that needs to be processed by the DexBuilder, making the build process more efficient.
// Example (using React.lazy):
const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));

// 2. Tree Shaking (using Rollup):
// Use a bundler like Rollup to remove unused code from your application. 
// Rollup's tree-shaking effectively eliminates unnecessary parts of your codebase that are not used,
// significantly reducing the size of your final Android build.

// 3. Optimizing Dependencies:
// Review your package.json for redundant or unnecessarily large dependencies. Consider using lighter-weight 
// alternatives.  Avoid importing entire libraries when you only need specific components.

// 4. ProGuard (for advanced optimization):
// ProGuard is a powerful tool that can significantly reduce the size of your Android application by removing 
// unused code and renaming classes and fields. It's particularly beneficial for larger projects.
// To use ProGuard with Expo, consult the Expo documentation on the subject.

// 5. Cleaning the project:
// Regularly clean your Expo project: `expo prebuild --clean`
// This removes the build cache and ensures that the next build is performed from a clean slate.

// Implementing these techniques, either individually or in combination, typically resolves the 
// DexBuilder TransformException.  Experiment and monitor your build progress to find the most effective strategy for your project.
