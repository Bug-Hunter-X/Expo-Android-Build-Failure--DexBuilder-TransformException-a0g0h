This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with the following error:  `Execution failed for task ':app:transformClassesWithDexBuilderForRelease'. > com.android.build.api.transform.TransformException: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: com.android.ide.common.internal.LoggedErrorException: Failed to run command: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java -classpath ... (very long classpath) ...  The exact error message can vary, but it usually indicates that the DexBuilder is failing to process the classes. This is often caused by a combination of factors, including the size of the application, the number of dependencies, and the complexity of the code.
